1) Basic Variable Definition

In Python, variables are defined by simply assigning a value using the = operator. The variable name should be descriptive and follow naming conventions.

name = "Gaith"
age = 19
is_student = True

2. Naming Conventions
Snake_case: Variable names should be in lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
Avoid Reserved Words: Don’t use Python’s reserved words as variable names (e.g., def, class, for).
first_name = "Gaith"
user_age = 19


3. Type Annotations (Optional but Professional)
While Python is dynamically typed, you can add type annotations to make your code more readable and maintainable.

name: str = "Gaith"
age: int = 19
height: float = 1.75


4. Constant Variables
By convention, constants (variables that shouldn't change) are named in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

PI = 3.14159
MAX_USERS = 100

5. Multiple Assignments
You can assign multiple variables in one line, which can be useful but should be used judiciously to maintain readability.
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30

6. Unpacking
Unpacking is a powerful feature where you can assign values from a list or tuple directly to variables.
